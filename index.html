            <p align="justify">
              I have good interpersonal skills and good adaptability to organizational environments.
              Due to my analytical thinking and excellence in managing people and processes, I have consistently grown in the companies where I worked and conquered leadership positions.
              In constant pursuit of improving my skills, I graduated both in Law and in IT, both areas also with postgraduate degrees.
              Combining all the knowledge acquired with my vast experience, I am a professional who feels comfortable working both with IT and administration.
              I am currently in a career transition and learning Java with SpringBoot, an area I intend to work in.

              <p align="justify">Uplit is an ecommerce app that allows you to create your own webshop in which you can sell your groceries.</p>
              <p align="justify">I worked as a freelancer and was one of those responsible for modeling a relational database focused on a webshop application. More specifically, I helped to define relationships, attributes, tables, and flow, with the online "Class Diagram" modeling software called "Diagrams".</p>
              <p align="justify">After defining the database class model, I developed the "models" using Django/ORM. Later, these models were updated using PostgreSQL. Moreover, all models were registered in both the “Admin.py” and “settings.py” modules, so that they became visible in the administration interface of "Django Admin".</p>
              <p align="justify">In several situations, I also had to use pgAdmin to directly access the Postgre database and manipulate the data using SQL language.</p>
              <p align="justify">I developed some application resources (endpoints) leveraging modules such as: URLs, View, Models, Oauth2 Authentication API. To test this solution, I used the “Insomnia” tool.</p>
              <p align="justify">I also used Shell/Django and QuerySet to develop the “Unit Tests” to validate the integrity of models and prevent future errors.</p>
              <p align="justify">Regarding project management, we used Agile Scrum methodology and Jira Software to plan and track our progress through the sprints. Also, we used GitLab as our hosting platform for version control and collaboration.</p>
              <p align="justify">I participated in several remote meetings with customers from Canada. After each meeting, our Product Owner defined the customer's needs in the Backlog and together with us, developers, defined the responsibilities of each in the Sprint of the week.</p>
              <p align="justify">To successfully complete the Sprint activities, I had to delve into technologies such as Git, GitFlow, Docker, Merger request, CI/CD continuous integration etc.</p>
